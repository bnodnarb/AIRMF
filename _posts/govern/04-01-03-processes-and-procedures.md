<br>
Risk management resources are finite in any organization. Adequate AI governance policies delineate the mapping, measurement, and prioritization of risks to allocate resources toward the most material issues for an AI system to ensure effective risk management. Policies may specify systematic processes for assigning mapped and measured risks to standardized risk scales. 

AI risk tolerances  range from negligible to critical – from, respectively, almost no risk to risks that can result in irredeemable human, reputational, financial, or environmental losses. Risk tolerance rating policies consider different sources of risk, (e.g., financial, operational, safety and wellbeing, business, reputational, or model risks). A typical risk measurement approach entails the multiplication, or qualitative combination, of measured or estimated impact and likelihood of impacts into a risk score (risk ≈ impact x likelihood). This score is then placed on a risk scale. Scales for risk may be qualitative, such as red-amber-green (RAG), or may entail simulations or econometric approaches. Impact assessments are a common tool for understanding the severity of mapped risks. In the most fulsome AI risk management approaches, all models are assigned to a risk level.

<summary markdown="span">**Suggested Actions**</summary>
- Establish policies to define mechanisms for measuring or understanding an AI system’s potential impacts, e.g., via regular impact assessments at key stages in the AI lifecycle, connected to system impacts and frequency of system updates.
- Establish policies to define mechanisms for measuring or understanding the likelihood of an AI system’s impacts and their magnitude at key stages in the AI lifecycle. 
- Establish policies that define assessment scales for measuring potential AI system impact. Scales may be qualitative, such as red-amber-green (RAG), or may entail simulations or econometric approaches. 
- Establish policies for assigning an overall risk measurement approach for an AI system, or its important components, e.g., via multiplication or combination of a mapped risk’s impact and likelihood (risk ≈ impact x likelihood).
- Establish policies to assign models to uniform risk scales that are valid across the organization’s AI portfolio (e.g. documentation templates), and acknowledge risk tolerance and risk levels may change over the lifecycle of an AI system.

**Organizations can document the following:**
- What metrics has the entity developed to measure performance of the AI system and the system’s components? To what extent do the metrics provide accurate and useful measure of performance?
- What policies has the entity developed to ensure the use of the AI system is consistent with its stated values and principles?
- What assessments has the entity conducted on data security and privacy impacts associated with the AI system?
To what extent does the system/entity consistently measure progress towards stated goals and objectives?
