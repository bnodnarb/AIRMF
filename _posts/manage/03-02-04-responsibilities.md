<br>
Superseding (bypassing), disengaging, or deactivating/decommissioning a model, AI system component(s), or the entire AI system may be necessary when: 
- a system reaches the end of its lifetime
- detected or identified risks exceed tolerance thresholds
- adequate system mitigation actions are beyond the organizationâ€™s capacity
- feasible system mitigation actions do not meet regulatory, legal, norms or standards. 
- impending risk is detected during continual monitoring, for which feasible mitigation cannot be identified or implemented in a timely fashion. 

Safely removing AI systems from operation, either temporarily or permanently, under these scenarios requires standard protocols that minimize operational disruption and downstream negative impacts. Protocols can involve redundant or backup systems that are developed in alignment with established system governance policies (see GOVERN 1.7), regulatory compliance, legal frameworks, business requirements and norms and l standards within the application context of use. Decision thresholds and metrics for actions to bypass or deactivate system components are part of continual monitoring procedures. Incidents that result in a bypass/deactivate decision require documentation and review to understand root causes, impacts, and potential opportunities for mitigation and redeployment. Organizations are encouraged to develop risk and change management protocols that consider and anticipate upstream and downstream consequences of both temporary and/or permanent decommissioning, and provide contingency options.

<summary markdown="span">**Suggested Actions**</summary>

- Regularly review established procedures for AI system bypass actions, including plans for redundant or backup systems to ensure continuity of operational and/or business functionality.
- Regularly review Identify system incident thresholds for activating bypass or deactivation responses.
- Apply change management processes to understand the upstream and downstream consequences of bypassing or deactivating an AI system or AI system components.
- Apply protocols, resources and metrics for decisions to supersede, bypass or deactivate AI systems or AI system components.
- Preserve materials for forensic, regulatory, and legal review.
- Conduct internal root cause analysis and process reviews of bypass or deactivation events. 
- Decommission and preserve system components that cannot be updated to meet criteria for redeployment.
- Establish criteria for redeploying updated system components, in consideration of trustworthy characteristics

<summary markdown="span">**Transparency and Documentation**</summary>
<br>
**Organizations can document the following:**

- What are the roles, responsibilities, and delegation of authorities of personnel involved in the design, development, deployment, assessment and monitoring of the AI system?
- Did your organization implement a risk management system to address risks involved in deploying the identified AI solution (e.g. personnel risk or changes to commercial objectives)?
- What testing, if any, has the entity conducted on the AI system to identify errors and limitations (i.e. adversarial or stress testing)?
- To what extent does the entity have established procedures for retiring the AI system, if it is no longer needed?
- How did the entity use assessments and/or evaluations to determine if the system can be scaled up, continue, or be decommissioned?
