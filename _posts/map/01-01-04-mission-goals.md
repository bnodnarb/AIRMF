<br>
Socio-technical AI risks emerge from the interplay between technical development decisions and how a system is used, who operates it, and the social context into which it is deployed. Addressing these risks is complex and requires a commitment to understanding how contextual factors may interact with AI lifecycle actions. One such contextual factor is how organizational mission and identified system purpose create incentives within AI system design, development, and deployment tasks that may result in positive and negative impacts. By establishing comprehensive and explicit enumeration of AI systems’ context of of business use and expectations, organizations can identify and manage these types of risks.

<summary markdown="span">**Suggested Actions**</summary>

- Document business value or context of business use 
- Reconcile documented concerns about the system’s purpose within the business context of use  compared to the organization’s stated values, mission statements, social responsibility commitments, and AI principles.
- Reconsider the design, implementation strategy, or deployment of AI systems with potential impacts that do not reflect institutional values.

**Organizations can document the following:**
- What goals and objectives does the entity expect to achieve by designing, developing, and/or deploying the AI system?
