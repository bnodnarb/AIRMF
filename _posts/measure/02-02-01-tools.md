<br>
Documenting measurement approaches, test sets, metrics, processes and materials used, and associated details builds foundation upon which to build a valid, reliable measurement process.  Documentation enables repeatability and consistency, and can enhance AI risk management decisions.

<details>
<summary markdown="span">**Suggested Actions**</summary>

- Leverage existing industry best practices for transparency and documentation of all possible aspects of measurements. Examples include: data sheet for data sets, model cards, [commenters provided examples]
- Regularly assess the effectiveness of tools used to document measurement approaches, test sets, metrics, processes and materials used
- Update the tools as needed

<summary markdown="span">**Transparency and Documentation**</summary>
<br>
**Organizations can document the following:**

- Given the purpose of this AI, what is an appropriate interval for checking whether it is still accurate, unbiased, explainable, etc.? What are the checks for this model?
- To what extent has the entity documented the AI system’s development, testing methodology, metrics, and performance outcomes?
