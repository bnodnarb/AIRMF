<br>
Connecting policies, processes, and procedures and procedures to trustworthy characteristics can provide a roadmap for organizations looking to enhance internal practices and improve organizational accountability. Integrating trustworthy characteristics from the outset may also help ease organizational resources, by enabling AI actors to develop approaches for considering risk factors early rather than playing catch-up.

Establish and maintain formal AI risk management policies that address AI system trustworthy characteristics throughout the system’s lifecycle. Organizational policies should:
* Establish AI risk management policies that broadly align to AI system trustworthy characteristics.
* Define key terms and concepts related to AI systems and the scope of their intended use.
* Address the use of sensitive or otherwise risky data.
* Outline and document risk mapping and measurement processes and standards.
* Verify that formal AI risk management policies align to existing legal standards, and industry best practices and norms.
* Verify that formal AI risk management policies include currently deployed and third-party AI systems.
* Detail standards for experimental design, data quality, and model training.
* Detail model testing and validation processes.
* Detail and test incident response plans.
