<summary markdown="span">**About**</summary>
<br>
The development of a risk-aware organizational culture starts with the definition of responsibilities. Under ideal risk management settings, oversight professionals are independent from model developers and report through risk management functions or directly to executives, countering implicit biases such as groupthink. This creates a firewall between technology development and risk management functions, so efforts cannot be easily bypassed or ignored.

Facilitating a culture where AI system design and implementation decisions can be questioned and course-corrected by empowered stakeholders provides organizations with tools to anticipate and effectively manage risks before they materialize.

<summary markdown="span">**Transparency and Documentation**</summary>
<br>
**Organizations can document the following:**
- To what extent has the entity clarified the roles, responsibilities, and delegated authorities to relevant stakeholders?
- Who is ultimately responsible for the decisions of the AI and is this person aware of the intended uses and limitations of the analytic?
- Are the responsibilities of the personnel involved in the various AI governance processes clearly defined?
- What are the roles, responsibilities, and delegation of authorities of personnel involved in the design, development, deployment, assessment and monitoring of the AI system?
- Did your organization implement accountability-based practices in data management and protection (e.g. the PDPA and OECD Privacy Principles)?
