AI systems are dynamic and may perform in unexpected ways once deployed. Continuous monitoring is a risk management process for tracking unexpected issues and performance, in real-time or at a specific frequency, across the AI system lifecycle.

Incident response and “appeal and override” are commonly used processes in information technology management that are often overlooked for AI systems. These processes enable real-time flagging of potential incidents, and human adjudication of system outcomes. 

Establishing and maintaining incident response plans can reduce the likelihood of additive impacts during an AI incident. Smaller organizations which may not have fulsome governance programs, can utilize incident response plans for addressing system failures, abuse and misuse.

* Establish policies and procedures for monitoring AI system performance, and to address bias and security problems, across the lifecycle of the system.
* Establish policies for AI system incident response, or confirm that existing incident response policies address AI systems.
* Establish policies to define organizational functions and personnel responsible for AI system monitoring and incident response activities.
* Establish mechanisms to enable the sharing of feedback from impacted individuals or communities about negative impacts from AI systems.
* Establish mechanisms to provide recourse for impacted individuals or communities to contest problematic AI system outcomes.
