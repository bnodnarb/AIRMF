<br>
AI systems may not necessarily be the right solution for a given business task or problem. A standard risk management practice is to formally weigh an AI system’s negative risks against its benefits, and to determine if the AI system is an  appropriate solution. Tradeoffs among trustworthiness characteristics —such as deciding to deploy a system based on system performance vs system transparency–may require regular assessment throughout the AI lifecycle.

<summary markdown="span"><span style="color:#FBFAF5">**Suggested Actions**</span></summary>

- Consider trustworthiness characteristics when evaluating AI systems’ negative risks and benefits.
- Utilize TEVV outputs from map and measure functions when considering risk treatment.
- Regularly track and monitor negative risks and benefits throughout the AI system lifecycle including in post-deployment monitoring.
- Regularly assess and document system performance relative to trustworthiness characteristics and tradeoffs between negative risks and opportunities.
- Evaluate tradeoffs in connection with real-world use cases and impacts and as enumerated in Map function outcomes.

**Organizations can document the following:**

- How do the technical specifications and requirements align with the AI system’s goals and objectives?
- To what extent are the metrics consistent with system goals, objectives, and constraints, including ethical and compliance considerations?
- What goals and objectives does the entity expect to achieve by designing, developing, and/or deploying the AI system?
