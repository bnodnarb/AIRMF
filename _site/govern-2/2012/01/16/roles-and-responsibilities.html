  <summary><strong>What is this subcategory about?</strong></summary>
  <p><br />
The development of a risk-aware organizational culture starts with the definition of responsibilities. Under ideal risk management settings, oversight professionals are independent from model developers and report through risk management functions or directly to executives, countering implicit biases such as groupthink. This creates a firewall between technology development and risk management functions, so efforts cannot be easily bypassed or ignored.</p>

  <p>There are numerous approaches for establishing strong risk management structures and tailoring them to the organizational risk profiles and resources. Facilitating a culture where AI system design and implementation decisions can be questioned and course-corrected by empowered stakeholders provides organizations with tools to anticipate and effectively manage risks before they materialize.</p>

  <summary><strong>How can organizations achieve the outcomes of this subcategory?</strong></summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Establish policies that define the AI risk management roles and responsibilities for:
      <ul>
        <li>Boards of directors or advisory committees</li>
        <li>Senior management</li>
        <li>AI audit functions</li>
        <li>AI design</li>
        <li>AI development</li>
        <li>Human-AI interaction</li>
        <li>AI testing and evaluation</li>
        <li>AI acquisition and procurement</li>
        <li>Impact assessment functions</li>
        <li>Oversight functions</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Establish policies that promote regular communication among teams participating in AI risk management efforts.</li>
    <li>Establish policies that separate management of AI system development functions from AI system testing functions, to enable independent course-correction of AI systems.</li>
    <li>Establish policies to prevent conflicts of interest, and counteract confirmation bias and market incentives that may hinder AI risk management efforts.</li>
  </ul>
