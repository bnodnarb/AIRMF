NISTâ€™s initial draft of this Playbook as a companion to the  AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF). We would value your feedback about the approach and content.
Individuals who would like to review the draft Playbook are encouraged to comment on:
1. Its relative usefulness as a complementary resource to the AI RMF.
2. Whether the guidance is appropriately specific.
3. Whether the guidance is actionable, especially as related to organization size.
4. Suggested presentation alternatives for the forthcoming first version of the Playbook, to ensure effectiveness and ease of use.

Feedback may be provided to NIST as comments or as specific line-edit additions or modifications. NIST also welcomes references to existing or new resources to help users of the AI RMF. All feedback should be sent via email to <a href="mailto:AIframework@nist.gov">AIframework@nist.gov.</a>
