Welcome to the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) Playbook. The Playbook provides stakeholders with actions they can take to achieve outcomes in the framework and is to be used in support of the AI Risk Management Framework. 
<br>
It includes suggested actions, references and supplementary guidance for “<strong>Map</strong>” and “<strong>Govern</strong>” – two of the four proposed functions in the <a href="">AI RMF</a>.
<br>
Draft material for the other two functions, <strong>Measure</strong> and <strong>Manage</strong>, will be released at a later date.
<br>
For more information about the AI RMF Playbook please go to <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework/ai-rmf-playbook">AI RMF Playbook</a>.
