<br>
Risk refers to the composite measure of an event’s probability of occurring and the magnitude (or degree) of the consequences of the corresponding events. The impacts, or consequences, of AI systems can be positive, negative, or both and can result in opportunities or risks.  

Organizational risk tolerances are often informed by several internal and external factors, including existing industry practices, organizational values, and legal or regulatory requirements. Since risk management resources are often limited, organizations usually assign them based on risk tolerance. AI risks that are deemed more serious receive more oversight attention and risk management resources.

<summary markdown="span">**Suggested Actions**</summary>

- Assign risk management resources relative to established risk tolerance. AI systems with lower risk tolerances receive greater oversight, mitigation and management resources. 
- Document AI risk tolerance determination practices and resource decisions.
- Regularly review risk tolerances and re-calibrate, as needed, in accordance with information from AI system monitoring and assessment .

<summary markdown="span">**Transparency and Documentation**</summary>
<br>
**Organizations can document the following:**

- Did your organization implement a risk management system to address risks involved in deploying the identified AI solution (e.g. personnel risk or changes to commercial objectives)?
- What assessments has the entity conducted on data security and privacy impacts associated with the AI system?
- Does your organization have an existing governance structure that can be leveraged to oversee the organization’s use of AI?
