Organizations usually engage multiple third parties for external expertise, data, software packages (both open source and commercial), and software and hardware platforms across the AI lifecycle.  

The need to rely on external resources or expertise may heighten existing challenges in an already complex undertaking, increasing the difficulty of risk management efforts. 

Organizational approaches to managing third-party risk should be tailored to the resources, risk profile, and use case for each system. Organizations should strive to apply governance approaches to third-party AI system and datal as they would for internal resources — including open source software, publicly available data, and commercially available models.
