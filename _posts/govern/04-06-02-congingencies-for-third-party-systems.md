**Organizations can document the following:**
- To what extent does the plan specifically address risks associated with acquisition, procurement of packaged software from vendors, cybersecurity controls, computational infrastructure, data, data science, deployment mechanics, and system failure?
- Did you establish a process for third parties (e.g. suppliers, end-users, subjects, distributors/vendors or workers) to report potential vulnerabilities, risks or biases in the AI system?
- If your organization obtained datasets from a third party, did your organization assess and manage the risks of using such datasets?
