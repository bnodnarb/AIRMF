|  Key AI Functions      |   Descriptions     |
|:------------------------|:---------------------|
| **Organizational Management** | Organizational Management, Senior Leadership, and The Board of Directors are among the parties responsible for AI governance.  |
| **AI Design** <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> | Responsible for the planning, design, and data collection and processing tasks of the AI system. AI actors in this category include expertise from data scientists, domain experts, socio-cultural analysts, human factors experts, governance experts, data engineers, data providers, and evaluators. |
| **AI Development** <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>  <br/> | Responsible for model building and interpretation tasks, including creation or selection of models or algorithms, calibration and/or training and interpretation. These tasks involve machine learning experts, data scientists, developers, and experts with familiarity about the socio-cultural and contextual factors associated with the deployment setting. |
| **AI Deployment** <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>  |Includes AI actors who deploy the system into production. Related tasks include: piloting, checking compatibility with legacy systems, ensuring regulatory compliance, managing organizational change and evaluating user experience. AI actors in this category include system integrators, software developers, evaluators and domain experts with expertise in human factors, socio-cultural analysis, and governance.|
| **Impact Assessment**  <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> | AI Impact Assessors involve multidisciplinary AI actors with technical, human factor, socio-cultural, and legal expertise. They are responsible for assessing and evaluating requirements for algorithmic accountability, combating bias, examining intended and unintended impacts of AI systems, product safety, liability and security, among others. |
| **Third-Party Entities**  <br/> <br/>  | Provide AI systems/services to another organization or the organizationâ€™s customers or clients.       |
| **Domain Experts**  <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>  <br/> | Multidisciplinary practitioners or scholars with knowledge or expertise in an industry sector, economic sector, or application area where an AI system is being used. These experts are essential contributors for AI system design and development, and can provide important interpretation of outputs to support the work of TEVV and AI impact assessment teams.      |
| **Operation and Monitoring** <br/> <br/> <br/> | AI actors who are responsible for operating the AI system and work with others to continuously assess system output and impacts. Users who interpret or incorporate the output of AI systems, evaluators and auditors, and members of the research community are part of this group.|
| **End Users**  <br/>  <br/> | End Users (or intended users) of an AI system are the individuals or groups that use the system for a specific purpose. They interact with an AI system in a specific context.  |
| **Test, Evaluation, Validation and Verification (TEVV)**  <br/>| Includes AI actors who detect and remediate problems in a post-hoc fashion throughout the AI lifecycle. |
| **Teams** <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>TEVV tasks for design, planning, and data center on internal and external validation of assumptions for system design, data collection, and measurements, relative to the intended context of deployment or application.</li><li>TEVV tasks for development (model building) includes model development and, and model validation and  assessment.</li><li>TEVV tasks for deployment includes system validation and integration in production, with testing, tuning, and recalibration for systems and process integration, user experience, and compliance with existing legal, regulatory, and ethical specifications. </li><li>TEVV tasks for operation and monitoring involve ongoing monitoring to ensure periodic updates, testing, and recalibration of models, and the detection of emergent properties and related impacts.</li></ul>{:/} |
| **Human Factors**  <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> | Involve AI actors who provide expertise in human-centered design practices and methodologies, ensuring the active involvement of end-users and appropriate stakeholders, and broad integration of humans and human dynamics in all phases of the AI lifecycle. These professionals provide multidisciplinary skills and perspectives to understand context of use, engage multi- stakeholder processes, design and evaluate user experience (UI/UX), perform human-centered evaluation and testing, and inform impact assessments.   | 
| **Procurement**  <br/> <br/> <br/> | Includes contracting officials responsible for the financial, legal, and policy management of processes to acquire AI models, products, or services from a third party. developer, vendor, or contractor.  |
| **Impacted Individuals/Groups** | Any individual, group, community, or stakeholder organization affected by AI systems or decisions based on the output of AI systems, directly or indirectly. |
