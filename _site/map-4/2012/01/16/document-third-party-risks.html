  <summary><strong>What is this subcategory about?</strong></summary>
  <p><br />
Due to the complex nature of AI technology, organizations often engage third-party support. Technologies and personnel from third-parties are another source of risk to consider during AI risk management activities. Such risks may be difficult to map since third-party provider risk tolerances may not be the same as the contracting institution.</p>

  <p>Commercial, open source, and other freely-available technologies should be screened for third-party risks and transparently documented. For example, many reports suggest that the use of commercial large language models are a source of AI risks. These models are popular with AI developers due to their ease of use for inference tasks, and tend to rely on large uncurated web dataset or often have undisclosed origins. Large scale use of these models has raised concerns about privacy, bias, and unintended effects along with possible introduction of increased levels of statistical uncertainty, difficulty with reproducibility, and issues with scientific validity.</p>

  <summary><strong>How can organizations achieve the outcomes of this subcategory?</strong></summary>

  <ul>
    <li>Review audit reports, testing results, product roadmaps, warranties, terms of service, end-user license agreements, contracts, and other documentation related to third-party entities to assist in value assessment and risk management activities.</li>
    <li>Review third-party software release schedules and software change management plans (hotfixes, patches, updates, forward- and backward- compatibility guarantees) for irregularities that may contribute to AI system risks.</li>
    <li>Inventory third-party material (hardware, open-source software, foundation models, open source data, proprietary software, proprietary data, etc.) required for system implementation and maintenance.</li>
    <li>Review redundancies related to third-party technology and personnel to assess potential risks due to lack of adequate support.</li>
  </ul>

  <summary><strong>What are the transparency and documentation considerations?</strong></summary>
  <p><br />
<strong>Transparency Considerations â€“ Key Questions: MAP 4.1</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Did you establish a process for third parties (e.g. suppliers, end-users, subjects, distributors/vendors or workers) to report potential vulnerabilities, risks or biases in the AI system?</li>
    <li>If your organization obtained datasets from a third party, did your organization assess and manage the risks of using such datasets?</li>
    <li>How will the results independently verified?</li>
  </ul>
