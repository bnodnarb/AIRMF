<br>
To enhance organizational capacity and capability for anticipating risks, AI actors should reflect a diversity of experience, expertise and backgrounds. Consultation with external personnel may be necessary when internal teams lack a diverse range of lived experiences or disciplinary expertise.

To extend the benefits of diversity, equity, and inclusion to both the users and AI actors, it is recommended that teams are composed of a diverse group of individuals who reflect a range of backgrounds, perspectives and expertise. 

Without commitment from senior leadership, beneficial aspects of team diversity and inclusion can be overridden by unstated organizational incentives that inadvertently conflict with the broader values of a diverse workforce.

<br>
Organizational management can:
* Define policies and hiring practices at the outset that promote interdisciplinary roles, competencies, skills, and capacity for AI efforts.
* Define policies and hiring practices that lead to demographic and domain expertise diversity; empower staff with necessary resources and support, and facilitate the contribution of staff feedback and concerns without fear of reprisal.
* Establish policies that facilitate inclusivity and the integration of new insights into existing practice.
* Seek external expertise to supplement organizational diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility where internal expertise is lacking.
