Beyond Internal and laboratory-based system testing, organizational policies and practices should also consider AI system fitness-for-purpose related to the intended context of use.

Participatory stakeholder engagement is one type of qualitative activity to help AI actors answer questions such as whether to pursue a project or how to design with impact in mind. The consideration of how to convene a group and the kinds of individuals, groups, or community organizations to include is an iterative process connected to the purpose of the system being pursued. Other factors relate to how to collaboratively and respectfully capture stakeholder feedback and insight that is useful, without being a solely perfunctory exercise.

These activities are best carried out by personnel with expertise in participatory practices, qualitative methods, and translation of contextual feedback for technical audiences.

Participatory engagement is not a one-time exercise and should be carried out from the very beginning of AI system commissioning through the end of the lifecycle. Organizations can consider how to incorporate engagement when beginning a project and as part of their monitoring of systems. Engagement is often utilized as a consultative practice, but this perspective may inadvertently lead to “participation washing.”  Organizational transparency about the purpose and goal of the engagement can help mitigate that possibility.

<summary markdown="span">**How can organizations achieve the outcomes of this subcategory?**</summary>
* Ensure AI risk management policies address explicit mechanisms for receiving, processing, and implementing stakeholder and user feedback that could include:
    * Recourse mechanisms for faulty AI system outputs.
    * Bug bounties.
    * Human-centered design.
    * User-interaction and experience research.
    * Participatory stakeholder engagement with individuals and communities that may experience negative impacts. 
* Ensure that stakeholder feedback is considered and addressed, including environmental concerns, and across the entire population of intended users, including historically excluded populations, people with disabilities, older people, and those with limited access to the internet and other basic technologies.
* Clarify the organization’s principles as they apply to AI systems – considering those which have been proposed publicly – to inform external stakeholders of the organization's values. Consider publishing or adopting AI principles.
