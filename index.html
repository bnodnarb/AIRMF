The Playbook <strong>offers suggestions</strong> on how to navigate and use the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework">AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)</a>. These suggestions are intended to help users understand and address risks associated with the design, development, deployment, and use of AI systems.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2022; The current draft Playbook is based on <a  href="https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AI.100-1">AI RMF 1.0 </a>(released on January 26, 2023) and includes 
<span class="tooltip">suggested actions<span class="tooltiptext">Suggested Playbook actions are not intended to be comprehensive. Instead, they are intended to offer useful perspectives upon which users can construct a responsible AI program. To remain non-prescriptive, suggestions are specific, but are not extremely granular.</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">references<span class="tooltiptext">Suggested reference material is for informational purposes only. Such reference material is intended to serve as a sample of the available literature on a particular topic or subtopic.</span></span>, and <span class="tooltip">documentation guidance<span class="tooltiptext">Guidance for transparency efforts can be used by organizations in order to consider and document their AI risk management activities.</span></span> to achieve the outcomes for the four functions sprcified by the AI RMF: Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2022;  Playbook suggestions are developed based on best practices and research insights.

<br>
Playbook content is not considered final and has been released to enable community review and feedback about its informativeness, accuracy, and specificity. Aspects related to the presentation and delivery of Playbook suggestions are under development. Future online versions may include options for filtering or tailoring information to user preferences and requirements.
<br>
<br>
The Playbook is an online resource and will be hosted temporarily on GitHub Pages. Its permanent home will be in the NIST Trustworthy and Responsible AI Resource Center.
<br>
<br>
The AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0) and this companion Playbook are intended for voluntary use. 
<br>
<br>
The content of the AI RMF and this companion Playbook were each developed with a range of applications and risk levels in mind. Playbook users are expected to exercise discretion and to utilize whichever suggestions they believe are appropriate and relevant to their use cases or interests.  Certain elements of the guidance may not be applicable in specific contexts (such as in low-risk implementations).
