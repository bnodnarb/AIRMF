AI systems should present a business benefit beyond the status quo when considering inherent risks and implicit or explicit costs. Defining and documenting the specific business purpose of an AI system in a broader context of societal values helps teams to evaluate risks and increases the clarity of “go/no-go” decisions about whether to deploy.
