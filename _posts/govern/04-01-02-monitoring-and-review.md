<br>
Standardized documentation can operationalize how organizational AI risk management processes are implemented and recorded. Systematizing documentation can also enhance accountability efforts. By adding their contact information to a work product document, AI actors can improve communication, increase ownership of work products, and potentially enhance consideration of product quality. Documentation may generate downstream benefits related to improved system replicability and robustness. Proper documentation storage and access procedures allow for quick retrieval of critical information during a negative incident.
