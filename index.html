<br>
<br>
Playbook content is not considered final and is being released to enable community review and feedback about its informativeness, accuracy, and specificity. Aspects related to the presentation and delivery of Playbook suggestions are under development. Future online versions may include options for filtering or tailoring information to user preferences and requirements.
<br>
<br>
The Playbook is an online resource and will be hosted temporarily on GitHub Pages. Its permanent home will be in the NIST Trustworthy and Responsible AI Resource Center.
<br>
<br>
The AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0) and this companion Playbook are intended for voluntary use. 
<br>
<br>
The content has been developed considering a range of applications and risk levels. Playbook users are expected to exercise discretion and utilize as many – or as few – suggestions as they believe are appropriate and apply to their use cases or interests.  Certain elements of the guidance may not be applicable in various contexts, including in low-risk implementations.
