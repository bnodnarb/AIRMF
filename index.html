Welcome to the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) Playbook – a resource in support of the AI RMF. 
<br>
<br>
The Playbook includes suggested actions, references, and supplementary guidance that stakeholders can take to achieve outcomes for “<strong>Map</strong>” and “<strong>Govern</strong>” – two of the four proposed functions in the <a href="">AI RMF</a>.
Draft material for the other two functions, <strong>Measure</strong> and <strong>Manage</strong>, will be released at a later date.
