NIST’s initial draft of this Playbook serves as a companion to the AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF). We encourage feedback about the approach and content, especially:
1.    Its relative usefulness as a complementary resource to the AI RMF.
2.    Whether the guidance is actionable, especially as related to organization size.
3.    Suggested presentation alternatives for the forthcoming first version of the Playbook, to ensure effectiveness and ease of use.

Feedback may be provided to NIST as comments or as specific line-edit additions or modifications. NIST also welcomes references to existing or new resources to help users of the AI RMF.  


All feedback should be sent via email to <a href="mailto:AIframework@nist.gov">AIframework@nist.gov</a>. 
Since the Playbook is intended to be a dynamic source of online information there will not be a “final version.” Interested parties can submit contributions of guidance materials and feedback on a regular basis. **Please share initial comments by September 29, 2022**.
