<br>
Organizational risk response may entail identifying and analyzing alternative approaches, methods, processes or systems, and balancing tradeoffs between trustworthiness characteristics and how they relate to organizational principles and societal values. Analysis of these tradeoffs is informed by consulting with interdisciplinary organizational teams, independent domain experts, and engaging with individuals or community groups. These processes require sufficient resource allocation.

<summary markdown="span"><span style="color:#FBFAF5">**Suggested Actions**</span></summary>

- Plan and implement risk management practices in accordance with established organizational risk tolerances.
- Verify risk management teams are resourced to carry out functions, including
	- Establishing processes for considering methods that are not automated; semi-automated; or other procedural alternatives for AI functions. 
	- Enhance AI system transparency mechanisms for AI teams.
	- Enable exploration of AI system limitations by AI teams.  
	- Identify, assess, and catalog past failed designs and negative impacts or outcomes to avoid known failure modes.
- Identify resource allocation approaches for managing risks in systems:
	- deemed high-risk,
	- that self-update (adaptive, online, reinforcement self-supervised learning or similar),
	- trained without access to ground truth (unsupervised, semi-supervised, learning or similar), 
	- with high uncertainty or where risk management is insufficient.
- Regularly seek and integrate external expertise and perspectives to supplement organizational diversity (e.g. demographic, disciplinary), equity, inclusion, and accessibility where internal capacity is lacking.
- Enable and encourage regular, open communication and feedback among AI actors and internal or external stakeholders related to system design or deployment decisions.
- Prepare and document plans for continuous monitoring and feedback mechanisms.

<summary markdown="span"><span style="color:#FBFAF5">**Transparency and Documentation**</span></summary>
<br>
**Organizations can document the following:**

- Are mechanisms in place to evaluate whether internal teams are empowered and resourced to effectively carry out risk management functions?
- How will user and other forms of stakeholder engagement be integrated into risk management processes?
