<br>
AI actors should define the technical learning or decision-making task an AI system is designed to accomplish, along with the benefits that the system will provide. The clearer and narrower the task definition, the easier it is to map its benefits and risks, leading to more fulsome risk management.

**Organizations can document the following:**

- To what extent has the entity clearly defined technical specifications and requirements for the AI system?
- To what extent has the entity documented the AI system’s development, testing methodology, metrics, and performance outcomes?
- How do the technical specifications and requirements align with the AI system’s goals and objectives?
- Did your organization implement accountability-based practices in data management and protection (e.g. the PDPA and OECD Privacy Principles)?
- How are outputs marked to clearly show that they came from an AI?
