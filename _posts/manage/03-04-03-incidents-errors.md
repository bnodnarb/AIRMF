<br>
Regularly documenting an accurate and transparent account of identified and reported errors can enhance AI risk management activities., Examples include:
- how errors were identified, 
- incidents related to the error, 
- whether the error has been repaired, and
- how repairs can be distributed to all impacted stakeholders and users.

- Establish procedures to regularly share information about errors, incidents and negative impacts with relevant stakeholders, operators, practitioners and users, and impacted parties.
- Maintain a database of reported errors, incidents and negative impacts including date reported, number of reports, assessment of impact and severity, and responses.
- Maintain a database of system changes, reason for change, and details of how the change was made, tested and deployed. 
- Maintain version history information and metadata to enable continuous improvement processes.
- Verify that relevant AI actors responsible for identifying complex or emergent risks are properly resourced and empowered.
