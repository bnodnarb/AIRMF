<br>
Systems that function in a narrow scope tend to enable better mapping, measurement, and management of risks in the learning or decision-making tasks and the system context. A narrow application scope also helps ease oversight functions and related resources within an organization.

For example, open-ended chatbot systems that interact with the public on the internet have a large number of risks that may be difficult to map, measure, and manage due to the variability from both the decision-making task and the operational context.

* Consider narrowing contexts for system deployment, including factors related to:
    * How outcomes may directly or indirectly impact users and stakeholders.
    * Length of time the system is deployed in between re-trainings. 
    * Geographical regions in which the system operates.
* Engage AI actors from legal and procurement functions when specifying target application scope.
