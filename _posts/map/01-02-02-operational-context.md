<br>
An AI lifecycle consists of many interdependent activities involving a diverse set of actors that often do not have full visibility or control over other parts of the lifecycle and its associated contexts or risks. The interdependencies between these activities, and among the relevant AI actors and organizations, can make it difficult to reliably anticipate potential impacts of AI systems. For example, early decisions in identifying the purpose and objective of an AI system can alter its behavior and capabilities, and the dynamics of deployment setting (such as end users or impacted individuals) can shape the positive or negative impacts of AI system decisions. As a result, the best intentions within one dimension of the AI lifecycle can be undermined via interactions with decisions and conditions in other, later activities. This complexity and varying levels of visibility can introduce uncertainty. And, once deployed and in use, AI systems may sometimes perform poorly, manifest unanticipated negative impacts, or violate legal or ethical norms. These risks and incidents can result from a variety of factors. For example, downstream decisions can be influenced by end user over-trust or under-trust, and other complexities related to AI-supported decision-making.

Anticipating, articulating, assessing and documenting AI systems’ knowledge limits and how system output  may be utilized and overseen by humans can help mitigate the uncertainty associated with the realities of AI system deployments.

<summary markdown="span">**Suggested Actions**</summary>

- Document settings, environments and conditions that are outside the AI system’s intended use.   
- Design for end user workflows and toolsets, concept of operations, and explainability and interpretability criteria in conjunction with end user(s) and associated qualitative feedback.
- Plan and test human-AI configurations under close to real-world conditions and document results.
- Follow stakeholder feedback processes to determine whether a system achieved its documented purpose within a given use context, and whether end users can correctly comprehend system outputs or results.
- Document dependencies on upstream data and other AI systems, including if the specified system is an upstream dependency for another AI system or other data.
- Document connections the AI system or data will have to external networks (including the internet), financial markets, and critical infrastructure that have potential for negative externalities. Identify and document negative impacts as part of considering the broader risk thresholds and subsequent go/no-go deployment as well as post-deployment decommissioning decisions.

<summary markdown="span">**Transparency and Documentation**</summary>
<br>
**Organizations can document the following:**
- Does the AI system provide sufficient information to assist the personnel to make an informed decision and take actions accordingly?
- What type of information is accessible on the design, operations, and limitations of the AI system to external stakeholders, including end users, consumers, regulators, and individuals impacted by use of the AI system?
- Based on the assessment, did your organization implement the appropriate level of human involvement in AI-augmented decision-making? (WEF Assessment)
