<summary markdown="span">**About**</summary>      
<br>
Large-scale, high-performance computational resources used by AI systems for training and operation can contribute to environmental impacts.  Direct negative impacts to the environment from these processes are related to energy consumption, water consumption, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The OECD has identified metrics for each type of negative direct impact. 

Indirect negative impacts to the environment reflect the complexity of interactions between human behavior, socio-economic systems, and the environment and can include induced consumption and “rebound effects”, where efficiency gains are offset by accelerated resource consumption. 

Other AI related environmental impacts can arise from the production of computational equipment and networks (e.g. mining and extraction of raw materials), transporting hardware, and electronic waste recycling or disposal.

<summary markdown="span">**Suggested Actions**</summary>

- Include environmental impact indicators in AI system design and development plans, including reducing consumption and improving efficiencies.
- Identify and implement key indicators of AI system energy and water consumption and efficiency, and/or GHG emissions. 
- Establish measurable baselines for sustainable AI system operation in accordance with organizational policies, regulatory compliance, legal frameworks, and environmental protection and sustainability norms.
- Assess tradeoffs between AI system performance and sustainable operations in accordance with organizational principles and policies, regulatory compliance, legal frameworks, and environmental protection and sustainability norms.
- Identify and establish acceptable resource consumption and efficiency, and GHG emissions levels, along with actions to be taken if indicators rise above acceptable levels.
- Estimate AI system emissions levels throughout the AI lifecycle via carbon calculators or similar process.

<summary markdown="span">**Transparency and Documentation**</summary>
<br>
**Organizations can document the following:**

- How will the accuracy or appropriate performance metrics be assessed?
- How will the appropriate performance metrics, such as accuracy, of the AI be monitored after the AI is deployed? How much distributional shift or model drift from baseline performance is acceptable?
- What corrective actions has the entity taken to enhance the quality, accuracy, reliability, and representativeness of the data?
- Are there recommended data splits or evaluation measures? (e.g., training, development, testing; accuracy/AUC)
