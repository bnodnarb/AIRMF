<br>
AI systems are dynamic and may perform in unexpected ways once deployed. Continuous monitoring is a risk management process for tracking unexpected issues and performance, in real-time or at a specific frequency, across the AI system lifecycle.

Incident response and “appeal and override” are commonly used processes in information technology management that can be adopted for AI systems. These processes enable real-time flagging of potential incidents, and human adjudication of system outcomes.

Establishing and maintaining incident response plans can reduce the likelihood of additive impacts during an AI incident. Smaller organizations which may not have fulsome governance programs, can utilize incident response plans for addressing system failures, abuse and misuse.
