<br>
In the course of their work, AI actors often utilize open-source, or otherwise freely available, third-party technologies – some of which have been reported to have privacy, bias, and security risks. Additionally, third-party entities providing AI technologies may not be subjected to the same procurement, human resource, or other risk controls which are applied to more standard technologies. Organizations may consider tightening up internal risk controls for these technology sources.

* Supply resources such as model documentation templates and software safelists to assist in third-party technology inventory and approval activities.
* Review third-party material (including data and models) for risks related to bias, data privacy, and security vulnerabilities.
* Apply controls – such as procurement, security, and data privacy controls – to all acquired third-party technologies.

**Transparency Considerations – Key Questions: MAP 4.2**
- Did you ensure that the AI system can be audited by independent third parties?
- To what extent do these policies foster public trust and confidence in the use of the AI system?
- Did you establish mechanisms that facilitate the AI system’s auditability (e.g. traceability of the development process, the sourcing of training data and the logging of the AI system’s processes, outcomes, positive and negative impact)?
