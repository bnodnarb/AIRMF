<br>
Senior leadership in organizations that maintain an AI portfolio should be aware of AI risks and affirm the organizational appetite for such risks. 

Accountability ensures that a specific team and individual is responsible for AI risk management efforts. Some organizations grant authority and resources (human and budgetary) to a designated officer who ensures adequate performance of the institution’s AI portfolio (e.g.  predictive modeling, machine learning).
