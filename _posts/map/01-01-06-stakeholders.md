Risk management should include processes for regular and meaningful communication with stakeholder groups. Stakeholders can provide valuable input related to system gaps and limitations. Organizations may differ in the types and number of stakeholders with which they engage. 

Participatory approaches such as human-centered design (HCD) and value-sensitive design (VSD) can help AI teams to engage broadly with stakeholder communities. This type of engagement can enable AI teams to learn about how a given technology may cause impacts, both positive and negative, that were not originally considered or intended.

<summary markdown="span">**Actions**</summary>

* Maintain awareness and documentation of the individuals, groups, or communities who make up the system's internal and external stakeholders.
* Verify that appropriate skills and practices are available in-house for carrying out stakeholder engagement activities such as eliciting, capturing, and synthesizing stakeholder feedback, and translating it for AI design and development functions.
* Establish mechanisms for regular communication and feedback between relevant AI actors and internal or external stakeholders related to system design or deployment decisions. 
* Define which AI actors, beyond AI design and development teams, will review system design, implementation, and operation tasks. Define which AI actors will administer and implement test, evaluation, verification, and validation (TEVV) tasks across the AI lifecycle.

**Organizations can document the following:**
- To what extent has the entity clarified the roles, responsibilities, and delegated authorities to relevant AI actors?
- Who is responsible for checking the AI system at these intervals?
- What type of information is accessible on the design, operations, and limitations of the AI system to external stakeholders, including end users, consumers, regulators, and individuals impacted by use of the AI system?
- If anyone believed that the AI no longer meets this ethical framework, who will be responsible for receiving the concern and as appropriate investigating and remediating the issue? Do they have authority to modify, limit, or stop the use of the AI?
- How easily accessible and current is the information available to external stakeholders?
